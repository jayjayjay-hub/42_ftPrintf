    <b><i>A CUSTOM PRINTF FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION</i></b><br>
</p>

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

> _The objective of this project is to create a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C._

Printing formatted output is a common necessity in C programming, and the `ft_printf` project at 42tokyo provides an opportunity to craft your own version of the `printf` function. This project challenges you to understand the intricacies of formatting while enhancing your skills in C programming.

## ðŸ“š Usage

### Requirements

This project is written in C and requires the **`cc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the Function**

To compile the `ft_printf` function, navigate to the project directory and run:

```shell
$ make
```

## ðŸš€ Updates

### Integrated into libft

> _The `ft_printf` function has been seamlessly integrated into the [libft](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/libft) library as an additional feature._

- The integration with [libft](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/libft) enhances the utility of the library by providing a custom `printf` implementation.

These updates extend the functionality of the `ft_printf` project, offering a tailored printing solution for your C projects at 42tokyo.
